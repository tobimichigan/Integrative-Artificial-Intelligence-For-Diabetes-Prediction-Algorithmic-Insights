Integrative Artificial Intelligence For Diabetes Prediction: Cross-Validated Insights From Ensemble And Neural Architectures


<p>#ABSTRACT

Accurate prediction of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) events from heterogeneous, real-world datasets is crucial for early intervention and personalized monitoring. We present an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline that integrates dataset discovery, preprocessing, automated feature selection, and comparative evaluation of Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and a feed-forward Neural Network for T1D prediction. We combined 142 CSV files into a harmonized dataset of 1,307,891 rows with 43 columns. Preprocessing included column normalization, imputation (median for numeric, constant for categorical), outlier detection (Local Outlier Factor), and a standardized ColumnTransformer pipeline. Experiments used StratifiedKFold cross-validation (k=5) and an 80/20 stratified train/test split. Performance metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and ROC-AUC. Model selection used cross-validation F1 and test set performance. Logistic Regression achieved the highest measured performance (test accuracy = 1.0000; precision = 1.0000; recall = 1.0000; F1 = 1.0000), with cross-validation stability (mean F1 = 1.0000, std = 0.0000). Random Forest and the Neural Network also performed strongly (Random Forest test F1 = 0.9763; Neural Network test F1 = 0.9826). Visual diagnostics included confusion matrices, ROC curves, training history (accuracy/loss/precision/recall), and feature correlation heatmaps. A simple, well-configured Logistic Regression model produced near-perfect predictive performance under our pipeline. We discuss potential causes (true separability vs. dataset artifacts or label leakage), provide interpretability analyses, and recommend external validation and rigorous leakage checks before clinical deployment.
